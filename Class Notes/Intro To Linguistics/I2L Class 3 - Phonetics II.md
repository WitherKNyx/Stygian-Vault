Vowels!
Since vowels have the same manner of articulation, voicing and airstream mechanism, vowels are typologized by where they are in the mouth.

Place of articulation is usually reserved for consonants, there is no good cover term for place in vowels.

## Four dimensions of vowels
- Height of tongue in the oral cavity
- The anteriority (how far forward) of the tongue in the oral cavity
- The state of the lips (rounded or unrounded)
- Tenseness

* b**ee**t/**ea**ch - \[i]
* **i**t/sw**i**m - \[ɪ]
* st**a**y/th**e**y - \[e] or \[e_ɪ]
* B**e**n/fr**ie**nd - \[ɛ]
* c**a**t/st**a**ck/m**a**n - \[æ] (ash)
* c**u**t/s**o**me/b**u**t - \[ʌ]
* p**u**sition/**u**nderstand - \[ə] 
* pr**o**ve/b**oo**t - \[u] 
* p**u**t/t**oo**k - \[ʊ] 
* s**o**/gr**oa**n - \[o] or \[o_ʊ] 
* c**o**t/br**ou**ght - \[ɔ] 
* pl**o**t/f**a**ther - \[a]

Height refers to the height of the first formant, jaw, and the tongue
- High/close vowels: \[i], \[ɪ], \[u], \[ʊ]
- Mid vowels: \[e], \[ɛ], \[ə], \[ʌ], \[o], \[ɔ]
- Low vowels: \[æ], \[a]

Anteriority AKA the horizontal positioning of the tongue
- Front vowels: \[i], \[ɪ], \[e], \[ɛ], \[æ]
- Central vowels: \[ə], \[ʌ]
- Back vowels: \[u], \[ʊ], \[o], \[ɔ], \[a]

Are the lips rounded during vowel production?
- Rounded vowels: \[u], \[ʊ], \[ɔ]
- All others are unrounded

Tenseness AKA how tense the tongue is during vowel production AKA how central extreme the tongue is during vowel production
- Tense: \[i], \[e], \[u], \[o]
- Lax: \[ɪ], \[ɛ], \[æ], \[ə], \[ʌ], \[ʊ], \[ɔ], \[a]

### Dipthongs
Sh**y**/b**i**ke/**eye** - \[a_ɪ]
d**ow**n/c**ow** - \[a_ʊ]
b**oy**/aster**oi**d/destr**oy** - \[ɔ_i]/\[ɔ_ɪ]

### Suprasegmental Features 
AKA features above the segments
Vowels and consonants can have length variation (long v. short) (add a : after vowel, i.e. \[u:]

Pitch during the pronunciation of a syllable can be different. Some languages have high tone and low tones, others add contour tones (in between). Some have up to 7-9

A study found vocal fold vibration becomes less precise in more arid climates. In more tropical climates, vocal fold vibration and control is more precise, thus they are more amenable to the development of complex tonal systems.
