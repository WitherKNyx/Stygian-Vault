The emergence of language probably happened around 60-200 thousand years ago

Evidence used to claim this include: fossil records to estimate vocal tract anatomy, synchronic comparative studies, dna sequencing and investigation of genetic components of language disorders, philosophizing

## Theories for evolution of language
- evolved for social communication
- evolved as a tool to help us think
- evolved as an exaptation (it just sort of happened?)

Which came first, sign language or spoken language?
What are the genetic components of language?
Do we really know anything about language evolution at all?
