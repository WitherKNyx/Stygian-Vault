Generative syntacticians claim that sentences have hierarchical structure.

That meas we dont just read words one by one to figure out what they mean.

A constituent is a phrase that goes together that forms a coherent unit.

Each constituent represents a syntactic phrase. Each phrase is built around a single phrase, the head of the phrase

The constituent type is of the same syntactic category as the head.

Head:

- Noun - Noun phrase
- etc.

We usually have intuitions about which group of words goes together as a constituent

There are some test we can use to determine if a group of words is a constituent

If it passes at least one test, its a constituent

Constituency Tests:

1. Conjunction
    - If you can add “and” plus another constituent of a known category to the group of words, and remain grammatical, it’s a constituent
2. Substitution
    - Substitute the group of words we are curious about with a pronoun/proform. If it’s grammatical, it’s a constituent
3. Movement
    - Move part of the sentence we want to test to another place in the sentence. If it’s grammatical, the test succeeded and the group is a constituent

Syntactic trees are a way to visualize the hierarchical relationships between different words and constituents.

Each tree represents a sentence and the different nodes represent the constituents

Syntactic Categories:

- S (sentence)
- NP (noun phrase) - has the same distribution as a pronoun/proper name
- N (noun) - needs a determiner to itf left to form a NP
- Det (determiner) - occurs to the left of the noun to form a NP
- Adj (adjective) - occurs in between a determiner and a noun; can combine with noun to its right which results in an expression which is a N
- VP (verb phrase) - consists minimally of a verb and all its complements. Combines with an NP to its left which results in a sentence
- IV (intransitive verb) - does not need an NP complement to form a VP
- TV (transitive verb) - needs an NP complement to form a VP
- DTV (ditranisitve verb) - needs two NP complements to form a VP
- SV (sentential complement verb) - needs a sentential complement to form a VP
- Adv (adverb) - can be a VP adjunct (combines with a VP to its left) which results in an expression which is a VP
- P (preposition)- combines with an NP to form a PP
- PP (prepositional phrase - can be a VP or an N adjunct; consists of a preoposition and its NP complement

Used to represent the rules of syntactic combination. Optional elements in parentheses

Demonstratives include articles, numerals, possesive pronouns, quantifiers, and demonstratives
