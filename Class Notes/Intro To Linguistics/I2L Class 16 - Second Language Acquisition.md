It is clear that learning a language is harder when older,

Whether this correlates with a critical period is debated

Plasticity refers to the capability to form new neural connections

During the first few years of life, our brains demonstrate the most plasticity, but over time, neural connections and pathways become specialize and plasticity decreases

Native-like pronunciation is almost impossible to attain

The sounds and prosodic patterns of a language are the first things that infants learn

How many words one needs to know to speak a second language varies (2000 for simple convos, 4000 beyond most simple of topics)

Its more about learning collocations (combinations of words that appear together)

Learning a new grammar is difficult if there is a concept that doesnt exist in your first language

Interlanguage - A L2 learner’s unique system that is neither of their languages but something in between

Fossilization is when L2 errors persist

Harder to index identity in second language

i.e., “hey” “hello” “sup” “greetings” are different but for a L2 learner it may be difficult to learn how

politeness strategies may be different, formality may be different

No first language is easier to learn, but some second languages are easier, especially if the language is similar to the first language

Behaviorism claims that children learn through imitation and reinforcement. Applied to L2 learning, repetition of hearing and speaking and writing sentences will lead to development of habits and fluency

We’ve moved more away from behaviorism

Communicative approach: expose learners to the language without any explicit instruction and they will eventually pick up the language

Focus on form approach: combines previous approaches; main emphasis is on meaning and tasks, but also includes explicit instruction on difficult points like grammar

Input frequency matters a lot

But there’s too many individual differences which makes one ideal learning system impossible to generalize

Suprasegmental features over segmental features may be better to learn.

L2 learners who receive instruction on prosody demonstrate better spoken fluency than those who only learned segmentals

Learning phrases > words

Direct translation leads to clunky constructions

Learning about politeness and formality and pragmatic tendencies is also important

2 types of bilinguilism - Sequential, learning one native and then another later, and Simultaneous, learning 2 at the same time as a child. Simultaneous bilinguilism may achieve full native fluency in both languages

There is another category - heritage speakers. They are exposed to 2+ languages in a home/family setting from an early age

The home language is a minority language, and the speaker is stronger in the dominant language

Heritage speakers may be anywhere on a continuum of fluency

They many learn the language in the home with other familt members, in classes outside of school

If L1 is not the dominant language, being bilingual is pressured and necessary

If L1 is the dominant language, being bilingual is praised and seen as a benefit
