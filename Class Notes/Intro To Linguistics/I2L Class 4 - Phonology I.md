Phonetics relates to the study of speech sounds and their articulation by human beings. What are the acoustic and articulatory properties of the sounds we can produce?
There’s more to language the sounds, and it’s hard to distinguish between sounds that don’t exist in out language.

Phonology deals with sound systems.
In phonetics, the basic sound units (phones) are objectively distinctive.
The basic units in phonology (phonemes) are less objective and depend on the language system we operate within.

Phones are presented with [narrow transcription], phonemes are presented in /slashes/
Phonemes are the officially acknowledged sound categories that exist in a language - mental representations (such as /p/ and /s/)

Allophones are additional realizations that map onto acknowledged categories. If /t/ is a phoneme in English, allophones of /t/ can be observed in words like batter \[ɾ], top \[$\text{t}^\text{h}$] and stop \[t]

The categories we separate the sound into are called phonemes, while the different ways it actually sounds in words are allophones

The phoneme is an abstract concept/category and allophones are the actual uses. We typically use the basic allophone as a representation of the phoneme. The allophone with the least restricted distribution is the basic allophone

Minimal pairs are pairs of words in a particular language which vary only by the identity of a single speech sound but have distinct meaning. If two sounds contrast in minimal pairs, then they must belong to different phonemes.

Minimal pair: spot & slot
Not minimal pairs: \[spat] and \[s$\text{p}^\text{h}$at] (does not change the meaning), pit and spit (must have same number of sounds), bit and pat (must differ in one sound), fig and fir (vowels dont always sound the same), lip and mip (must be real words)
If there is no minimal pair, write down the environments for each sound and check if there is overlap.

If two sounds do appear in the same environment, they are in contrastive distribution. 
If they never appear in the same environment, then they are in complementary distribution and we can say they are allophones of the same phoneme
Phoneme and allophone division isn't objective or strictly based on the properties of sounds.
Separate phonemes in one language can be allophones in another.
