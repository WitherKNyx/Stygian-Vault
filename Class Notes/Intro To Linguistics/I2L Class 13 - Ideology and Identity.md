Language Ideology - the set of societally shared beliefs about a a language or a language variety

In the USA there is a standard language ideology, which entails considering a abstract variety as the standard form, Stand American English, which is held up as the standard form by the educational system, the media, corporate America

Nothing about the this standard form is inherently or systematically better than any other, only because it is used by those who hold power is it the standard

Other forms become substandard

Some dialects are prestigious at the societal level

Overt Prestige - when a dialect or an individual feature is viewed positively by society at large

Overt Stigma - viewed negatively by society at large

Covert Prestige, Covert Stigma, same but only within a local community

Ideologies exist at the societal level

Language attitudes - beliefs about languages/varieties at the individual level

they can be stereotypes or manifest as discrimination

Individuals can use language to index identity

Using certain linguistic features will cause people to access their own language attitudes and develop beliefs about you as an individual

Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Socioeconomic status, Education level, Age, Location all link to language variation

One example of a categorical dialect is African-American English (AAE), which exists based on ethnicity

AAE was seen as a deficit, but linguists have demonstrated that AAE is a system like any other language

AAE is supra-regional, speakers who use AAE are indexing an identity when doing so.

There is not a generalizable 1:1 straightforward mapping of a langauge variety to a particular identity (some white suburban youth adopt AAE)

Most people are good at switching styles when talking to different groups of people. (style switching)

Sometimes this appears as using different dialect (bidialectalism)

A register is a language variety associated with specialized activities of particular group

There are formal registers (legalese, religious), and informal registers (gamer speech)
