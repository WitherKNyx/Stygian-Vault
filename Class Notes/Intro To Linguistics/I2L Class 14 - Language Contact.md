Pidgins are a type of natural language that arise when speakers of different languages need to suddenly communicate with each other

Generally limited in lexicon and have a relatively simplified structure relative to the founding languages

When a child is born into a pidgin speaking family and learns it as thei  rnative language, the language changes its status and becomes a creole

Creoles are usually considered separate entities and not a part of the family of their source language

The two source languages are categorized as superstrate and substrate

Superstrate is also called a lexifier, it is the language that is more dominant socially and most words in the creole lexicon stem from

The other language is called a substrate which contributes grammatical structure

Prominent creoles:

- Tok pisin (Papua New Guinea; Superstrate: English; Substrates: Austronesian languages)
- Jamaican Patois (Jamaica; Superstrate: English; Substrates: Jamaica)
- Hawaiian Creole (Hawaiian; Superstrate: English; Substrates: Hawaiian, Cantonese, Portugese)
- Louisiana Creole (Lousiana; Superstrate: French; Substrates: West African languages)
- Gullah (Superstrate: English; Substrates: West African languages)

Possible causes for similar words appearing in different languages: 

- Geographical proximity - People in neighboring areas will inevitably communicate
- Multilingualism - people speak multiple languages
- Colonialism - Speakers of a colonized area may be forced to adopt the colonizing language
- Technological advancement - People/cultures in distant locations with whom we have no physical contact are now easily accessible

Borrowing can be lexical like burrito or deja vu, or phonological, like [zh] from russian/polish to hebrew, or french to english

Grammatical borrowings are rarer

Prestige borrowings - In pre-communist-revolution russia, nobles spoke french, a sign of status
