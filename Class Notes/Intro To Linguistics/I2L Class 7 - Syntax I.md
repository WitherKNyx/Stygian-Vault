Syntax is a model of the language, a set of grammatical particles (words) which can be combined into phrases and sentences

The function having such a model is being able to discuss how specific languages work and some dimensions in which languages differ

This type of model is also useful for posing questions regarding peoples cognitive abilities even if the model doesnt necessarily represent the language faculty in our heads

much of the data in syntax comes from grammaticality judgements. Any native speaker is an expert

Grammaticality judgements tap into descriptive grammar

Semantics deals with sentence meaning, syntax deals with sentence structure.

Syntax influences sentence meaning

Principle of compositionality: meaning of a sentence depends on the way that expressions are syntactically combined

You can have grammatical sentences that are not semantically coherent and ungrammatical sentences that are semantically coherent

Expressions interact with other expressions in specific ways

Generally two types of co-occurences: arguments (req) and adjuncts (opt)

Non-subject arguments are called complements

Some expressions require multiple complements

English almost always requires a subject, other languages can omit subjects

Other expressions are optionally attached to other expressions - adjuncts

the same phrase could be an argument or an adjunct in different scenarios

Words are that basic units syntax deals with

For the purpose of syntax, a word is the thing between two spaces/a space and a pinctuation

nouns are words used to identify people places and things

Nouns are an open class of words, meaning that new items can be easily be added to that class (this happens through borrowing and creating new words)

In many languages, nouns can be inflected to reflect case (nominative\subject, accusative\object, genitive\possessive)

Verbs (predicates) describe actions, occurrences or states

Verbs are also an open class of words

In many languages, verbs express one or more of: plurality, gender, tense, and person

Useful categorizations of verbs:

- Transitive verbs require an additional complement
- Intransitive verbs do not require any additional complements
- Ditransitive verbs require two complements

Adjectives describe attributes of nouns

In some languages, adjectives have morphological marking for plurality, gender, or case

Adverbs modify verbs

Adpositions appear before (preposition) or after (postposition) a noun and expresses a relation of that noun to another element in the clause

Words combine to slightly bigger units called phrases

Each phrase has a head, which determines the type of phrase it is

noun - head of noun phrase

verb - head of verb phrase

preposition - head of prepositional phrase

Combination of some phrases  yields sentences

noun phrase + verb phrase = sentence

Noun phrases (NPs) are headed by a noun and can have dfferent modifiers that attach/dependents to them (demonstrative, numeral, adjective, determiner, relative clause)

Prepositional phrases (PPs) need to have a preposition as head and a dependent noun phrase

VErb phrases (VPs) are headed by a verb. Verb phrases can contain adverbs, PPs, object NPs, etc.

Head verb in a verb phrase is called a predicate

Certain types of word classes can assume certain types of roles in a sentence. Nouns can be subjects or objects, verbs are still verbs.

English uses SVO, but other languages use other orders. (SOV, VSO, Obscure[VOS, OVS, OSV])
