Morphology is simply the study of form. 
In linguistics, word forms.

A word is an independent phonologically coherent linguistic unit in a sentence

A sentence consists of at least one clause, which consists of at least a verb, which is a word.

Shrug is the answer

morphemes are not necessarily words. Certain sounds may be morphemes and words, but they can be distinct.

A morpheme is the smallest meaningful part of a word. 1) figure out what a word is and 2) figure out what’s meaningful

In certain languages, discovering morphemes is as simple as comparing word forms to one another

What abut plural forms? Books gets glossed as `book-p`, and geese gets glossed as `goose.p`

Period notation suggest the plural form is nonseparable from the word

Agglutinative languages are ones in which it is relatively easy to separate affixes from roots and each other.

Fusional languages are ones in which it is relatively difficult to separate affixes from roots and each other

Synthetic languages are ones in which words are frequently the combination of many morphemes

Analytic languages are ones in which there is frequently only one morpheme per word

Allomorphs are when the same morpheme can have different phonological realizations (pronunciations)

s, sh, tsh, dge are **sibilants** - hissy

Free morphemes can stand alone as words. Free morphemes contain exactly one word.

Bound morphemes are morphemes that cannot occur on their own

Bound morphemes contain affixes

Root - the semantic heart of the word - affixes get added to this (also called a stem)

Prefix - affix before the root

Suffix - affix after the root

Infix - affix goes inside the root (Tagalog: Buy = bili; Bought = b***um***ili)

Circumfix - affix goes around the root (Malay: Fair = adil; Fairness = ***ke***adil***an***)

Inflection and Derivation

If two different words in a language would belong to the same dictionary entry, they can be said to belong to the same lexeme, a basic vocabulary item

Adding an inflectional morpheme does not create a new lexeme (chipmunk → chipmunks)

Derivation creates a new lexeme (visit → visitor)

Some english inflectional morphemes:

- plural -s
- possesive -s
- third person singular -s
- past tense -ed
- present progressive -ing
- comparative -er
- superlative -est

typically derivational morphemes change the part of speech (but not always)
