Linguistics is an interdisciplinary topic
Linguistics is empirical, not philosophical, but it is not prescriptive.
Grammar is the set of mental rules speakers have, often these are the same for people from the same linguistic community
Every language/dialect/person has a grammar
We can gather data on grammar through observation, survey, and experimentations
grammaticality is based on structure, not meaning
Linguistic competence is your internal knowledge of language. Being hidden, we must instead study linguistic performance
We learn more when people make errors
Linguists don't always speak many languages, and encourage linguistic diversity
An application of linguistics is to create constructed languages
Jan Misali conlangs time
6500-7000 languages in the world, with 830 in Papua New Guinea alone

Dialects vs languages is odd to define
Most languages are auditory-vocal, others are visual-gestural
## Design features of language
1. Needs a mode of communication
2. Semanticity: Signals must have meaning or function
3. Pragmatic functions: they must also be useful
4. Interchangability: Individuals can send and recieve signals
5. Cultural transmission: Some aspects are transmitted only through interaction
6. Displacement: Messages can be about subjects not immediately present
7. Discreteness: Combinable units produce bigger units
8. Productivity: Novel messages from discrete units
9. Open-ended: infinite unique combinations
10. Arbitrariness: the connection between form and meaning is arbitrary
11. Recursion: The ability of a constituent to embed another constituent of the same type within
