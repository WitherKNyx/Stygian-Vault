Psycholinguistics is the intersection of linguistics and psychology, studying the acquisition, storage, comprehension, and production of language

Neurolinguistics is the study of the neural and electrochemical bases of language development

There is no single language center, there are many systems that interact (activating lexicon, phonetic info, interpreting phonetic info, and directing muscles in vocal tract) (Middle & Inferior Temporal Gyri â†’ Inferio Frontal Gyrus â†’ motor cortex)

Aphasia is a loss of ability to produce or understand language due to stroke or brain injury

Brocaâ€™s aphasia results in difficulty planning motor sequences to produce language (difficulty forming complete words/sentences)

Wernickeâ€™s aphasia results in difficulty in comprehension (nonsense sentences)

Brocaâ€™s area is the inferior frontal gyrus which is responsible for organizing articulatory patterns and directing the motor cortex, as well as processing complex sentence

Wenickeâ€™s area is the superior temporal gyrus, associated with language comprehension and lexical access

Left-handed are more likely to not be left hemisphere language dominant

Contralateralization - the left side of the brain controls the right side, vice versa

There are different ways of describing the time sequence of processing models (serial, parallel), interactions between stages of a model (modular, interactive)

Serial & Modular used to be popular, now Parallel & Interactive

Evidence for speech production models com from speech errors

Speech Errors:

- Anticipation - a later unit substituted for and earlier unit (reading list â†’ leading list)
- Perseveration - an earlier unit substituted for a later one (reading list â†’ reading rist)
- Metathesis - two sounds switch (fill the pool â†’ pill the fool/fool the pill)
- Spoonerism is a metathesis with the first sounds of two words (save the whales â†’ wave the sails)

Lexical bias effect - phonological speech errors lead to production of real words more often than expected by chance (parallel evidence)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Make your beds â†’ Bake your meds

Morphological substitution - two morphemes switched (i put rice in the pot â†’ i put pot in the rice)

Top-down processing is using higher cognitive processes to arrive at the goal

bottom-up processing - using sensory input without higher cognitive processes to arrive at the goal

Voicing is something that can be measured acoustically thru Voice Onset Time (time between opening of the constriction at the end of the stop and the vibrating of the coval folds in the vowel)

Voiced sounds have a nearly nonexistent VOT (0ms), voiceless sounds have a VOT around 60ms

20-40ms range is ambiguous

Lexical access is the process of accessing a word form the set of words we know, either determining what words we are hearing based on acoustic input or searching for a word in order to produce it

Resting activation - a baseline level of how likely a word is to be activated

frequency - how likely, based on frequency, a given word is to be accessed

spreading acitvation for word n+1 changes based on word n

Our implicit knowledge of syntax guides our processing of sentences

Garden path sentences are an example of temporary ambiguity

Lexical decision task - participants read/hear a word and have to quickly identify if it is a real word

Self-paced reading - participants move through a sentance, one word at a time, clicking to see the next word

The underlying assumption is that there is a direct relationship between processing speed and processing difficulty

EEG! Good temporal resolution, bad spatial

Event related potentials - EEG measured when participants read/hear sentences/words and brain responses are analyzed at the onset of a particula stimulus

fMRI has high spatial resolution but bad temporal
