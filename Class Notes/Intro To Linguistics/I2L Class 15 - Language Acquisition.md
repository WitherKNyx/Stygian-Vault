Children learn language exceptionally fast!

But theyre kinda dumb

Why????

THere are a few theories

Nativist theories stress bioloical learning

Functionalist theories stress social aspects of learning

There are also cognitive and statistical bases

There’s something about the human brain that lalows us to learn language

many think there is a critical period in which children have to learn language (up to about puberty)

It’s easy to learn languages then, but harder after

Cognition - mental processes that take in information, store it as knowledge and applu this knowledge in various ways

Our minds must have special cognitive abilities that allow us to learn and use language

Psycholinguistics is the study of this type of knowledge and processing

AN extension of cognitive basis, children are very good at gathering statistics from environment

Social interaction is crucially important in proper development of language in children

Social basis for language learning is formed through eye contact

Eventually children develop associations between forms and functions, with the help of social info

Nature - the child’s innate capacities relevant to language acquisition

Nurture - the properties of the environment relevant to language acquisition

Acquisition Mechanisms - the specific means by which the child comes to have and use linguistic knowledge

Adult Grammar- theoretical assumptions made about the language that the child is in the process of acquiring

Universal grammar (by Noam Chomsky) is the most prolific nativist theory

Chomsky claims that all children are born with the abstract structure for language capability already installed and ready to learn based on environmental input

Functionalist theories stress nurture. Discourse is crucial in shaping the cognitive development of language skills

Human cognition is the special innate talent that allows us to learn language quickly, not an innate abstract grammar

These cognitive skills arent language specific and are inexorably linked with social development

Imitation theory claims that children learn language by imitating what they her in the environment

They do imitate what they hear around them, but language has infinite combinations and humans can create fucked up new sentences.

This poverty of the stimulus means there must be some sort of innate biological supplement to the input children get

Reinforcement theory claims that children learn language through direct feedback from adults - positive reinforcement confirms correct productions, corrections fix incorrect productions

Adults often give reinforcement to children, correcting mistakes, but not every time

Child Directed Speech seems to help children learn

Includes characteristics such as high pitch, exaggerated intonation, short utterances, proper nouns, repetition and focuses on here-and-now, cross-linguistically universal

It is grammatical and fluent, the content and prosodic characteristics help children identify relations between forms and functions

Newer theories of language acquisition posit that infants’ brains are constantly keeping statistics

They take in language and use the input associations to create neural connections which in turn feed their productions

These theories claim that children dont learn rules but rather utilize statistical information to determine the most probably associations

TIMELINE

In utero, perception of low-freuqency voice properties

0-2 months - perception of phonetic distinctions

6-10 months - reduplicated babbling (baba)

10-14 months - nonreduplicated babbling (badida) and production of simpler consonants

12 months - gesture + sound combinations with consistent communicative functions  + first word

12-16 months - repetoire of speech acts

12-18 months - gesture + word combinations

18 months - two word combinations + 50 word vocabulary

1.5-4 years - first 14 grammatical morphemes (present progressive -ing, in, on, plural -s, irregular past, possesive -’s)

2 years - early grammatical constructions

2-2.5 improving conservation skills

2-3 years - beginning to be able to narrate personal experiences

Phonological errors

Final consonant deletion

Consonant cluster reduction

Sound substitution patters

Comprehension precedes production

Lexical errors

Overextension - a word used for a larger set of referents

Underextension - a word used for a smaller set of referents

Morphosyntactic errors

Overregularization - applying a grammatical rule in a situation where it doesnt apply

Different ways to study language development: 

Observational - data taken through observation of natural occurrences

Experimental - data taken through observation of experimentally manipulated occurrences

Longitudinal studies track development of subjects throughout their individual development over time

Cross-sectional gather data from multiple subjects at one time in different stages of development
