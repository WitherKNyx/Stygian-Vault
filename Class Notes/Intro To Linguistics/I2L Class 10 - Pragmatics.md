Semantics was defined as the meanings of words and propositions and looked at through word expression senses and proposition truth-conditions

Linguistic context: the discourse that precedes the phrase or sentence to be interpreted.

Situational context: anything nonlinguistic in the situation 

An utterance is a sentence conveyed to another person

Meaning can also be classified according to its purpose in conversation: speech acts.

- Questions
- Statements
- Opinions
- Requests
- Commands

Indirect speech acts are ones that are used different than they are technically.

Goals of politeness: Avoid conflict, build rapport with interlocators, promote cooperative communication

Face is roughly synonymous with self-image

Face is emergent and arises from interactions

Positive face is the desire to be approved of by others

Negative face is the desire to be independent and unbothered

A face-threatening act is an act that threatens someones face

Positive politeness caters to positive face by appealing to solidarity, friendliness, compliments, etc.

Negative politeness caters to negative face by trying to avoid imposition, giving options, etc.

Politeness Strategies

- Bald on-record
    - Direct, least polite
- Positive politeness
    - Direct, bit more polite
- Negative politeness
    - Direct, non-confrontational, more polite
- Off-record
    - Indirect
- Don’t do the FTA
    - Doesn’t accomplish anything

Strategy chosen depends on three factors

- Social distance between speaker and hearer
- Power difference between speaker and hearer
- Ranking of imposition on the hearer

Pragmatic inferences are the type of ‘extra’ meaning that we communicate/interpret from utterances; they are not explicitly communicated through the sense of words and meanings of propositions

Pragmatic inferences are not entailed

H Paul Grice proposed the Cooperative Principle - a speaker’s utterances should contribute to the purpose and direction of the conversation

These 4 maxims are not rules but a description of behavioral norms in discourse

Violations of the maxims should not be noticed. Flouts are purposefully breaking the maxims in a way that is interpretable by others.

1. Quality - Speakers must only assert truthful information that is supported by evidence.
2. Quantity - Speakers must be informative and provide enough information (not too much and not too little).
3. Relevance / Relation - Speakers must be relevant.
4. Manner - Speakers need to be clear, brief, orderly, and not ambiguous

Relevance theory is another framework which keeps only the principle of relevance

Utterances are meant to be relevant to the discourse

Language changes constantly.

Slang is the best example, they change constantly, shuffled in and out

Great Vowel shift occurred between 15th and 18th

boot used to be pronounced [bo:t]

The way words are spelled and their morphology can indicate the root languages

English :French, Greek, German, Dutch

Synchronic rules describe the way something is right now

Diachronic rules describe historical changes that occurred in the past

There are many phonological changes that can occur in a language

Lenition - consonants become weaker or even disappearing

Epenthesis/Excrescence - the addition of a consonant

Epenthesis/Anaptyxis - an addition of a vowel

Prosthesis - adding a sound/syllable in the beginning of a word to break ca consonant cluster

Palatalization - a constant becoming palatal or palatalized

Fusion - two sounds merging into one

Breaking - one vowel sound separating into two

Metathesis - reordering sounds within a word

Raising and Lowering, Fronting and Backing - vowels moving within the vowel space

grammatical particles like clitics, articles, prepositions, are usually short

they are not randomly chosen for those functions

They are items which grammaticalized from lexical words that we ften use, which gradually became shorter due to frequent use and speaker familiarity

They undergo a process where they lose part of their meaning (semantic bleaching) and then become shorter (morphological change)

Expansions - a word gains additional meanings

Reduction - a word now has fewer meanings

Semantic Shift - a word changes its meaning

Syntactic Category Shift - a word gains or changes its part of speech

Clipping - longer word becomes shorter word

Acronym - a word formed by taking the first letters in a phrase

Borrowing - taking a word from another language

Loss of words - words that are no longer used

Blend - one word created from two words

Eponym - proper noun becomes common word

Coinage - spontaneous creation of a new word
