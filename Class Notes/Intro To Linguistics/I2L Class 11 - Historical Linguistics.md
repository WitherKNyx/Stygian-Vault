# Lecture 11: Historical Linguistics

The fact that two languages share words or grammatical phenomena does not necessarily mean the two are historically related

It could be that there was contact between two languages, or it could be coincidence

Languages that come from the same parent language are considered siblings

Ethnologue lists 136 different language families

Six of these stand out as major families, each with ≥ 5% of world’s languages, accounting for 2/3 of world’s languages and 5/6 of world population

- Afro-Asiatic (Berber, Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic)
- Austronesia (Tagalog, Cebuano, Malay, Malagasay)
- Indo-European (English, Spanish, German, Hindi, Russian, Farsi)
- Niger-Congo (Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo, Fula)
- Sino-Tibentan (Chinese, Burmese, Central Tibetan)
- Trans-New-Guinean (Kamoro, Mek, Kiunum)

Comparative method:

1. Look for recurring/systematic correspondences between two languages we suspect are related
2. Decide what is a plausible proto-form for sounds and words
3. Devise regular rules to explain how we got from a proto-form to the languages we are now examining

Common sound changes:

- Assimilation (sounds become similar to neighbor sounds)
- Final devoicing (Consonants devoice at the end of words)
- Cluster simplification (loss of consonants in a cluster)
- Lenition - Stop weakening (stops become fricatives between vowels)
- Deletion (consonants being deleted)

Sonority hierarchy: Geminate stop > stop > affricate > fricative > approximant or [h] or [glottal] > nothing

Farther back = weaker

Priorities:

1. Make sure changes work within the logic of the dataset
2. Common sound changes are more likely than uncommon sound changes
3. Fewer changes is more likely than more changes
