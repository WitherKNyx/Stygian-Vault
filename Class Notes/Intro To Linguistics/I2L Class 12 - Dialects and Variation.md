A variety of a language is any form of the language which differs systematically from other forms of the language. These differences could mean there are rules to define the variation

No language variety is better than another

A dialect is a language variety that is characteristic of a specific group (geography, ethnicity, social class, gender identity, etc.)

Most popular metric for determining language vs dialect is mutual intelligibility

All dialects are linguistically equal

“A language is a dialect with an army and a navy”

Geographically adjacent dialects may have mutual intelligibility, which forms a dialect continuum, where the languages at each end of the continuum may not have mutual intelligibility

What defines a dialect may be more political than technical

There are multiple ways of defining regional dialects with varying levels of specificity: Phonological, lexical, syntactical

Isogloss - a line drawn on a map to represent boundaries for one feature

If there are many overlapping bundles of isoglosses, that constitutes evidence for a regional dialect

Wave model - change spreads outward from a metropolitan area

Cascade model - change skips from metropolitan are to metropolitan area, affecting the areas with the least population density last

Both outdated now thanks to internet
