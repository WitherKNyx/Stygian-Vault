Vocalization isn’t completely necessary for linguistic expression, but its the most common modality
Most believe vocalization came first, but its possible gestures were used first
Language in this course = speech modality

We make many sounds, not all are used in speech.
Mostly, speech is the sounds produced by the vocal tracts, specifically voluntary sounds
Some such sounds are not used as speech in any languages, so we exclude those as well

We can voluntarily control airflow in the vocal tract
These are typologized roughly in terms of _how_ we narrow the vocal tract

## Manners of Articulation
These are called manners of articulation: 
* Plosive (stop)
* Fricative
* Lateral
* Nasal
* Affricate

We can use our vocal folds in different ways while making other sounds: Phonation type
i.e. voiced `z` vs voiceless `s`
Whispering, Breathy voices, harsh voice, and creaky voice (vocal fry) are other phonation types
We can also expel (egressive) or inhale (ingressive) air during a particular speech sound
The movement of air may be controlled by the lungs (pulmonic), or other mechanisms (glottalic = ejectives, velaric = clicks): airstream mechanism

## Vocal Tract Anatomy
* Lips
* Teeth
* Nasal Cavity
* Alveolar ridge
* Hard palate
* Soft palate (velum)
* Tongue
* Mandible (jaw)
* Epiglottis
* Pharynx
* Epiglottis
* Thyroid cartilage (vocal cords)
* Artenoid cartilage
* Pharyngeal wall (Pharynx)/vocal folds - English doesnt use this, Farsi does

Not all of the possible sounds (1500) are not feasible (~100)

# IPA

Consonant symbols are generally learned from a grid identifying the places and manners of articulation + voicing characteristics
Outside the grid, special symbols describe different airstream mechanisms, + other diacritic symbols are provided in a loosely ordered list.

Vowels are produced with relatively little restriction of airflow.
Consonants are produced with some sort of obstruction of airflow

Columns denote the place of articulation, while rows denote the manner of articulation
## Place of Articulation
- Bilabial - put both lips together \[b] \[p] \[m] \[w]
- Labiodental - lower lip against top front teeth \[f] \[v]
- (Inter)dental - tongue in between top and bottom teeth \[θ] \[ð]
- Alveolar - tongue contacts alveolar ridge \[t] \[d] \[s] \[z] \[n] \[ɾ] \[l] \[ɹ]
- Post-alveolar - tongue contacts roof of mouth behind alveolar ridge \[ʃ] \[ʒ] \[t͡ʃ] \[d͡ʒ]
- Palatal - tongue contacts hard palate \[j]
- Velar - tongue contacts soft palate \[k] \[g] \[ŋ]
- Glottal - constriction at glottis (between vocal folds) \[h] \[ʔ]

## Manner of Articulation
- Stop (Plosive) - complete obstruction of the airflow \[p] \[b] \[d] \[t] \[k] \[g] \[ʔ]
- Fricative - nearly complete obstruction of the airflow \[f] \[v] \[θ] \[ð] \[s] \[z] \[ʃ] \[ʒ] \[h]
- Affricate - combination of a brief stop and fricative \[t͡ʃ] \[d͡ʒ]
- Nasal - lowered velum opens nasal cavity \[m] \[n] \[ŋ]
- Approximant (liquids and glides) - constriction not narrow enough to block vocal track
    - Retroflex - tongue tip curls back behind alveolar ridge \[ɹ]
    - Lateral - airflow passes around both sides of the tongue \[l]
    - Glides - only a very slight obstruction (almost like a vowel \[w] \[j]
- Tap/Flap - a very fast stop \[ɾ]
