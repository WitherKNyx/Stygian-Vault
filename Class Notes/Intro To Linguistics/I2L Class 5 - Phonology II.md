Different languages have different sound systems
Different sound systems have different categorizations for phonemes and allophones.
Our knowledge of a language phonology consists of knowing: what are the sounds of a language

## Solving a phonology problem
1. Look for minimal pairs. If there is a minimal pair with respect to the sounds in question, those sounds are separate phonemes.
2. List the phonetic environments of the sounds in question. Look for complementary distribution. If the sounds are in complementary distribution, they are allophones of the same phoneme. If they are in contrastive distribution, they are separate phonemes.
3. If they are in complementary distribution: figure out which is the basic allophone, which is the restricted allophone, and what the contexts for the restricted allophone are.
4. Write phonological rules

## Phonological rules
/s/ → \[sh] / \_\_i
/s/ → \[s] / elsewhere

Sounds that share a phonetic property in common form a natural class

Voiceless stops of English: \[p, t, k, ʔ]
Nasals of English: \[m, n, ŋ]

Obstruents - obstruct the air flow - stops, fricatives, flap, and affricates
Sonorants - do not obstruct the air flow - nasals, liquids, glides, vowels
