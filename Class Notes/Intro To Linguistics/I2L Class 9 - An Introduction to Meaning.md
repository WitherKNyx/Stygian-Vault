## Lexical Semantics

Reference is the actual entity in the world an expression picks out, the thing in the world that the sense defines.

Sense is the information needed to associate between the word and the reference, the properties the referent may have in all possible worlds.

Hyponym - the subset 

Hypernym - the superset

Mammals are hyponym, animals are hypernym

Synonym - two words that have exactly the same reference

Complementary antonym - categorical opposites in which $A \cap B = \emptyset$

Gradable antonym - opposites on a continuum in which something could be in the middle as well

## Adjectives

Adjectives can have different types of meanings, different ways of dividing nouns in the world

Intersective adjectives produce pure intersections like Finnish Accountant

Subsective adjectives are relative, need reference of the set

Anti-intersective adjectives form expressions that cannot include members of the set

Non-intersective adjectives form expressions that can include members of the set of nouns

## Thematic Roles

A verb assigns thematic roles to its arguments. Thematic roles are assigned to noun phrases based on its role within that sentence

Agent - the instigator of the action denoted by the verb

Experiencer - the one who experiences what is denoted by the verb

Theme - the entity that is moved or affected by the action denoted by the verb

Recipient - The entity that receives something as a result of the verb

Location - Where something takes place

Goal - the location or entity in the direction something moves

Source - the location or entity from which something moves

Instrument - the medium by which the action or event denoted by the predicate is carried out

## Sentence Meaning

Truth conditions - what must be the case for the proposition to be true

meaning - the things that need to be true for the entire sentence to be true

Truth values are whether a specific proposition is true or false

The meaning of a sentence is the collection of all the situations in which the sentence is true

Some elements of meaning dont have to do with truth conditions: Implied meaning (pragmatics), connotations, paralinguistic meaning (speakerâ€™s emotional, physical, and mental state)

## Types of Propositions

Most sentences are synthetic propositions: true or false depending on the situation

Some are tautological propositions: true by definition

Some are contradictions, never true.

If one or both parts of the tautology or contradiction are meant figuratively, they may no longer be such, they can be synthetic propositions

## Entailment and Implicature

Entailments are based on the truth conditions of a proposition. If proposition is true, its entrailment must be true.

Implicatures are meanings that can be inferred from general knowledge about either the world or the situation. It does not have to be true if the proposition is true

Implicatures can be cancelled or negated
